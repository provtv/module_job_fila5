# PRD - Job Module (2025-2026 Lean Standard)

## 1. Problem Statement
Background task management, scheduling, and import/export processes are currently handled by multiple disparate tools and manually managed tables. This complexity leads to maintenance overhead, lack of unified monitoring, and potential race conditions. There is a need for a centralized, type-safe module to orchestrate all job-related activities.

## 2. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
- **Compliance**: 100% PHPStan Level 10 across all module files.
- **Reliability**: < 0.1% failure rate for scheduled jobs.
- **Observability**: Real-time status of all batches and individual jobs in Filament.
- **Developer Experience**: Standardized pattern for creating new import/export actions.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### P0 (Critical)
- **Job Orchestration**: Unified resource to monitor and manage `jobs`, `failed_jobs`, and `job_batches`.
- **Scheduling**: Institutional-grade scheduler integration for recurring tasks.
- **Filament Resources**: All resources refactored into `Schemas/Tables` pattern.

### P1 (High Priority)
- **Import/Export Engine**: Base classes for Excel/CSV imports and exports with progress tracking.
- **Batch Management**: Ability to cancel or retry entire batches of jobs.

### P2 (Nice to Have)
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Stats overview for queue performance and health.
- **Notification Integration**: Alerts for failed critical jobs.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Agnostic Design
- The module must be independent of business logic (e.g., it shouldn't know about `Tickets` or `Workers`).
- Use generic `Import` and `Export` contracts.

### Data Schema
- Uses standard Laravel queue tables (`jobs`, `failed_jobs`, `job_batches`) plus custom `job_managers` and `schedules` tables.

## 5. Success Criteria
- All 9+ Filament resources refactored into the `Schemas/Tables` structure.
- Full quality pipeline (PHPStan L10) passes.
- Documentation cleaned and archived.
