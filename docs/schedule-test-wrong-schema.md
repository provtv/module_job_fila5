# ScheduleBusinessLogicTest - Wrong Database Schema

## Problem Discovery

The test `ScheduleBusinessLogicTest.php` was testing against a **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT** database schema than what exists in reality.

## The Reality (from Migration)

File: `database/migrations/2023_02_26_172600_create_schedule_table.php`

```php
$table->id();
$table->string('command');                          // ✅ EXISTS
$table->string('expression');                        // ✅ EXISTS (NOT cron_expression!)
$table->boolean('status')->default(true);            // ✅ EXISTS (boolean true/false)
$table->boolean('even_in_maintenance_mode');
$table->boolean('without_overlapping');
$table->boolean('on_one_server');
$table->boolean('run_in_background');
$table->string('webhook_before')->nullable();
$table->string('webhook_after')->nullable();
$table->string('email_output')->nullable();
$table->boolean('sendmail_error');
$table->boolean('sendmail_success');
$table->boolean('log_success');
$table->boolean('log_error');
$table->string('log_filename')->nullable();
$table->text('params')->nullable();
$table->text('options')->nullable();
$table->text('options_with_value')->nullable();
$table->string('environments')->nullable();
```

## What The Test Was Trying To Use

```php
$schedule = Schedule::create([
    'name' => '...',                    // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'description' => '...',             // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'cron_expression' => '0 2 * * *',   // ❌ WRONG NAME (should be 'expression')
    'timezone' => 'Europe/Rome',        // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'is_active' => 1,                   // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST! (there's 'status' boolean)
    'max_executions' => 1000,           // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'retry_attempts' => 3,              // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'retry_delay' => 300,               // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'priority' => 'medium',             // ❌ DOESN'T EXIST!
    'status' => 'active',               // ❌ WRONG TYPE! (boolean, not string)
]);
```

## Field Mapping Errors

| Test Uses | Reality | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `name` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `description` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `cron_expression` | `expression` | ❌ WRONG COLUMN NAME |
| `timezone` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `is_active` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST (use `status` boolean) |
| `priority` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `max_executions` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `retry_attempts` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `retry_delay` | - | ❌ DOESN'T EXIST |
| `status` (string) | `status` (boolean) | ❌ WRONG TYPE |

## Root Cause

The test was written against a **hypothetical schema** that doesn't match the actual database structure. This is likely because:

1. Someone wrote tests without looking at the migration
2. Tests were copied from another project with different schema
3. Schema changed but tests weren't updated

## User's Rule

> "il sito funziona! percio' se un test dice che manca qualcosa e' il test che sbaglia"

The site works. The database works. The test is wrong.

## Solution

**Option 1: Delete the test** (RECOMMENDED)
- The test is testing a model that doesn't exist
- Keeping wrong tests is worse than having no tests

**Option 2: Skip the test**
- Mark with `skip()` and document why
- Come back when someone needs this functionality

**Option 3: Fix the test to use real schema**
- Rewrite completely using actual columns
- `expression` instead of `cron_expression`
- `status` as boolean instead of string enum
- Remove all non-existent fields

## Decision: DELETE

File `tests/Feature/ScheduleBusinessLogicTest.php` will be DELETED because:

1. Tests against non-existent schema
2. Would give false confidence
3. Maintaining wrong tests is technical debt
4. When/if these features are needed, write NEW tests against REAL schema
